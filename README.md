# Exterior Point Algorithm
## Python implementation

This material is an academic postgraduate assignment. This is a Python Implementation of the "Exterior Point Simplex-type Algorithms for Linear and Network Optimization Problems". The algorithm was created by Konstantinos Paparrizos, Nikolaos Samaras and Angelos Sifaleras and can be found here. www.researchgate.net/publication/269336303_Exterior_Point_Simplex-type_Algorithms_for_Linear_and_Network_Optimization_Problems This is my own attempt to implement the exterior point algorithm, however there is a problem in its 3rd iteration. Please let me know if anyone corrects it.
